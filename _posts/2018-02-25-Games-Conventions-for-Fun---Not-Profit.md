It was our first time in a new venue which we were trying for several reasons, and the seemingly simple shift to a new place can sometimes cause a little regression in efficiency and efficacy across the event.</p><p name="7410" id="7410" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The rain has been pelting down all day. It’s 7pm the following evening, and I still haven’t unloaded the van or the trailer. The garbage bags are getting soaked but most of the tables are plastic, so that’s cool. We had record-breaking bookings &amp; attendance, so the kitty is healthy again. Things are okay, time to send out the feedback survey. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">DING DING DING</em> go the responses within seconds. I force myself not to read them until there are enough to ensure a good ratio of positive over negative to protect my emotional state. Con Drop is real, and between the joy, adrenaline, and sleep debt, I have no serotonin reserves for the start of the working week. I don’t suffer depression, but some of the colour will be sapped from my world until I get a few days of decent sleep and standard meals.</p><p name="96ef" id="96ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This attempt at a blog post isn’t a place for Con Orgs to complain about their lot. Our lot is self-inflicted, and when you approach it from the right angle, it’s mostly pleasure, powered by some work and occasional stress. The actual point of this little ramble is to offer some insight into out experiences, our goals, struggles, and (most interestingly) how these experiences can be modified by a variety of circumstances and influences.</p><blockquote name="8a2b" id="8a2b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I fell into this role by accident, and don’t regret it. I regret plenty of things along the way (file under “<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Aspects to Improve</em>”), but never the decision to drive each of our events to their mostly-successful conclusions. <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">It’s always a pleasure helping people play together</em>.</strong> Say it a few times, the slogan is infectious.</blockquote><p name="7701" id="7701" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">We were at the point where not only the historic trend of attendee numbers was threatening the viability of our previous venue, but climate control had also become a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">big issue</em>. Two events prior, we’d issued our first (and only) refund to a group whose infant was rendered inconsolable by January’s Australian summer heat. The venue had heating (useful in Winter, despite being on a timer requiring manual reset each hour lest it shut itself down) but no air-conditioning. Two fans in one of the rooms was not enough. Add to that the difficulty of managing three separate rooms, each with different furnishings and individual alarms to be disarmed and armed, furniture restored to original configurations…it wasn’t easy.</p><p name="4048" id="4048" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Two suburbs over, just 13 minutes’ drive, we found a cooler spot with a cooler building. In a park (shade, beauty and heatsink) opposite the train station. Two rooms, ample chairs/tables, better ventilation, more overall space and much simpler procedures. Even a baby change station! If we pushed to the end of Feb, the cusp of Autumn, we were likely to see a lower temperature. The only downside seemed to be the lack of accessibility ramp joining the rooms internally, but we could mitigate that by having three extra volunteers to manage the second external door in three shifts. Maybe give them other tasks like merch/raffle sales. Less visible, sure, but keeping the crowd filing through the door. It could work. Pin signs on the map walls explaining where all these things are located. Only the minority of the crowd would miss it, surely.</p><p name="2f90" id="2f90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s difficult to tell. People who read the wall signs, table signs, maps, website, emails or social posts often quietly find their answers and carry on. Those who don’t? They ask the staff instead, and are often surprised by the answers. “There’s another hall?” Someone asked me, and I don’t blame them. They had no reason to expect it, and no real motivation to discover it. Everyone comes to the event with their own interests and aims, and they might not notice the signage, or assume it’s for people with different interests or aims. It’s okay, but it can be frustrating trying to figure out the best way to help the most people with announcements, timing, signage and placement.</p><p name="7c46" id="7c46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We tried implementing a home-built library system, which looked great and was simple in its way, but lacked expected functions like reservation queues or barcode scanning. Today, pretty much a week too late, I searched for barcode plug-ins and accidentally found a library app with all the lending features we need, only uglier, for $5 per event. Damn. Sadly, it doesn’t have a snazzy realtime sort/search filter like ours did. It’s just usable for the basics, and faster, which is better overall, I guess? We could use it to set up the library in advance of the next event if the owners of the games just include a photo of the barcode in their submission form/email.</p><p name="95bb" id="95bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, I’m getting off-track, but it’s all relative to what we do between events, culminating in successes and failures across the various aspects of the event on the day. I’ll make another post as soon as I can, addressing examples of our goals (and when we’ve hit or missed them) and some key interactions &amp; experiences we’ve had with guests, sponsors, vendors, venues and suppliers.</p><p name="5de3" id="5de3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">-Matt Horam, Con Org for </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Ettin Con</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">.</em></p></div></div></section><section name="68c9" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="f292" id="f292" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--leading graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">NOTE</strong>: Every process we’ve established (and every system we’ve implemented) can be handed to you in the form of a white-label website-and-print solution, fully documented, configured and installed to taste, for a donation to our association.
