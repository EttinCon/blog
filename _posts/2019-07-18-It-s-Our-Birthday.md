<section name="9f9c" class="section section--body section--first"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="217f" id="217f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">One year from today, our little convention turns five! We started planning the party early, and we’re ready to share all the details now. We’re also ready to accept suggestions for how to make it better, and any interest from sponsors, vendors, demonstrators or volunteers who’d like to support us that weekend. Mark your calendars for the 18th and 19th of July, 2020:</p>

<blockquote name="70e3" id="70e3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--figure">We’ve been a bit nostalgic lately, looking at how far we’ve come. Since 2015, we’ve facilitated 78 hours of play across 7 events, including 227 hours of role-playing games across 76 sessions! This August, those numbers will look more like 90 hours of play, RPGs reaching 278 hours (93 sessions), and next year will leap impressively from there. We’re proud of what we’ve achieved as an independent non-profit organisation with volunteers and hard-won, limited sponsorship, alongside support of a great community of shops and players spanning five states. It’s really great to build our oasis each year to enjoy games with you all.</blockquote><p name="cddb" id="cddb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Like we’ve mentioned before on the blog, our goal has always been to achieve a weekend event without becoming unaffordable, so let’s talk about ticket pricing! We modeled a mild price increase on sticking to a maximum of one dollar per hour of play, absorbing booking fees and providing discounts for earlybirds and families. Additionally, buying a weekend ticket had to be cheaper than individual days, as an incentive to help attendance balance out our costs on both days. So here’s what we came up with:</p>

<figure name="d9ec" id="d9ec" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*5dRjbSaR89KUeHI0RV7ZiA.gif" data-width="1881" data-height="1552" alt="Ticket prices won’t exceed $1 per hour. Families pay for the first two of up to 5 players, early/weekend tickets discounted." src="/blog/assets/images/27b.gif"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Earlybird/Door prices for Sat, Sun, or Weekend: $10/$12, $7/$8, $15/$19 for a single ticket or multiply those by two for Families. Family tickets cover two adults and up to three supervised children under 16 years of age.</figcaption></figure>

<p name="897e" id="897e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We hope this is well-received, as people often tell us they’d be happy to pay double our old prices, but we have no desire to hike them that much. Working at premium conventions has reinforced to me that higher prices don’t guarantee a higher-quality experience, but always lower the accessibility. This is just enough to cover costs when attendance is comfortable (or lower) and potentially improve rewards for attendees and volunteers alike.</p><p name="b57b" id="b57b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now we have another eight hours of playtime(10am-6pm Sunday), we need to figure out what to do with them! Games on demand for RPGs is our first notion, because there’s always high demand for pick-up games without prior registration, and it also lessens the commitment/prep work for Game-Masters and organisational staff. Vendors who haven’t been able to attend our event (or host a stall) are better able to consider it if their business is closed on Sundays, too!</p><p name="93f8" id="93f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The <a href="https://monster.fandom.com/wiki/Tarrasque" data-href="https://monster.fandom.com/wiki/Tarrasque" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tarrasque in the room</a> is that a weekend event - despite allowing us to get home to sleep much earlier (post-packup) - is really enough for us, and the Summer break we had this year was a real relief. From here on, there will be no full Summer event, although we are discussing the possibility of a smaller, more casual Summer event with modified branding, on the condition that someone new takes the reins for it. Suggestions/volunteers for this are also very welcome. We need ideas, and people to make them happen.</p><blockquote name="8ce5" id="8ce5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing">So there you have it! We’ve finally reached a weekend format in time for our half-decade party, and you’re all invited in whatever capacity you choose! If you’d like to talk to us about vendor stalls/prize donations or volunteer work, please reach out via any of our social channels, or start a traditional conversation via email to either <a href="mailto:vendors@ettincon.org" data-href="mailto:vendors@ettincon.org" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" target="_blank">vendors@ettincon.org</a> or <a href="mailto:volunteer@ettincon.org" data-href="mailto:volunteer@ettincon.org" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" target="_blank">volunteer@ettincon.org</a>, respectively.</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="9cbe" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="e87b" id="e87b" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">-Matt Horam,<br>Con Org for Ettin Con<br></em><a href="mailto:info@EttinCon.org" data-href="mailto:info@EttinCon.org" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">info@EttinCon.org</em></a></p>
