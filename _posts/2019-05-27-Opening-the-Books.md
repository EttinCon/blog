Although details are certain, timing is important, so in lieu of the announcements themselves, this post will be about the things we can tell you, the things we feel would help anyone run a convention like ours.</blockquote><figure name="c97d" id="c97d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 462px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.10000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*fkUfrbGwZLy35NHNRguC2w.jpeg" data-width="2000" data-height="1321" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fkUfrbGwZLy35NHNRguC2w.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Gary Gygax was an insurance underwriter, after all.</figcaption></figure><p name="8a0b" id="8a0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Between June and August, a bunch of details about next year will be published/announced/broadcast, but the two things we can talk about today are <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">time</strong> and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">money</strong>. Being a clutch of volunteers with our own lives and businesses, there’s a deadline which has always been just out of reach for us — we’ve never been able to finalise/book/announce our next event by the day of the preceding one. That changes this year, because 2020 has to be ready if it’s going to be as big as we want it to be. Between June and August this year, our 2020 details will be announced, and tickets should be available from August 11th unless someone reads this and comes around to my house to beat me senseless. After four years of people asking “When is the next one?” on their way out the door, we’ll finally be able to answer that question with details and a call to action.</p><p name="44d6" id="44d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another thing about that timing is that it gives us the biggest lead time we’ve ever had to sell tickets, and we’ll need it! Currently, despite ticket sales being ahead of any previous event, skipping Summer means that our costs are sailing very close to each deadline. As of today, we need to take another 5 single bookings to cover costs. Insurance is due in July, flyers are running out so we’ll need to print some more to stay visible over the next twelve weeks, therefore 2019’s promo costs are likely to go up, and that means more bookings, please! If you’re planning to attend, please grab a cheap ticket now, it really helps. If you’d rather pay full price, just chuck us the extra dollars <a href="http://ettincon.org/#get-involved" data-href="http://ettincon.org/#get-involved" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via our donation button</a> after you’ve booked, or <a href="https://ettincon.org/merch" data-href="https://ettincon.org/merch" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy a shirt</a>!</p><p name="1e3f" id="1e3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the conversation turns to money, we’re going to be extremely clear, as in transparent. Our costs are something you should know if you want to run a convention in your locality, and our aim has always been to keep ticket prices so low that most people can enjoy our events within their means, even if that means we’re giving a few away at the door or panicking about scratching together the hire fees. Let’s break it down:</p><p name="4d50" id="4d50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Traditionally, we spend about $500 on public liability insurance &amp; electrical safety tagging each year. Refundable council bond for each event is $300 for the venues we use, and we’re looking to roll this year’s into the next one. Venue hire for a single twelve-hour day, plus setup/packup time, adds about $1k, even at half-rates for non-profits (being a non-profit costs us some annual government fees which are small-yet-significant). Printed posters, flyers, signs, website hosting, domain renewal, library software subscribtion and wifi as well as a banner ad on Board Game Geek (dot com) adds another $300, and table hire, which we’ve mentioned in prior blogs, is increasing in cost (not quantity) every time. Incidentals like wristbands, stationery, soap, garbage bags and first aid supplies are small enough to be negligable in these estimates, but they still cut into the kitty.</p><p name="748a" id="748a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All up, a single day’s event costs roughly AU$2000 at a minimum without detailing ticket provider and credit card fees. Our ticket prices have stayed low for years, despite some people saying they’d be happy to pay twice as much, we’ve never felt comfortable hiking them out of reach of others, even if it means we don’t have much of a budget for improving the library, etc. Early bird tickets of $8 and $16 (singles or families), then door prices of $10 and $20, along with raffle tickets and tourney fees, have always got us through, by the skin of our teeth or better, on the day.</p><blockquote name="7f8c" id="7f8c" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">It’s at this point that I absolutely MUST acknowledge we never would’ve achieved any of the library/arcade improvements or improved GM rewards without our <a href="https://patreon.com/EttinCon" data-href="https://patreon.com/EttinCon" class="markup--anchor markup--pullquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wonderful supporters at Patreon</a>, or the venue hire guarantee we were given by <a href="https:/afternoonified.com.au" data-href="https:/afternoonified.com.au" class="markup--anchor markup--pullquote-anchor" target="_blank">Afternoonified</a> for the years their Katoomba shop was open.</blockquote><p name="095e" id="095e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">If you look at our peak attendance of roughly 250 people, and break that down into an uneven split of families and individuals, you can probably see how only charging an average of about 83 cents per hour of gaming isn’t the safest model for us. For next year, we’re looking to change three things to make the event a safer and calmer bet to organise and run.</p><p name="8793" id="8793" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p"><span class="graf-dropCap">1</span> We’re investigating new pricing models which raise the average cost-per-hour by at least 17 cents, bringing it to a dollar, or slightly more, per hour. This sounds tiny because it deliberately is — the difference you would see in a single day’s ticket is about two dollars for an individual ticket, or four total for families of around five people. We’re still calculating if this is enough but it’s a really safe baseline and it’s worth talking about. It’s a small change which means surprise low attendance won’t put us into debt, and standard attendance would see funds for a bigger library, better arcade, and most importantly <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the possibility of better rewards for our volunteers</em>, both floor staff and GMs alike. The people who work the hardest on the day, when they could be playing, have been doing it for very little recompense, and it would be great to see that change in the future.</p><blockquote name="7057" id="7057" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Full Disclosure, with no regrets: As president of the association, I have no intention of ever paying myself a wage, and the most I’ve ever received from the event is a GM reward for running a game between floor shifts. The first few years of GM rewards were paid for by me personally, and the badge machine was also purchased by me to slowly pay for itself over the years (1/4 of each badge sale goes into machine &amp; materials). I’m still in debt for that and have no issue with it! This event is very much my personal project and I’m cool with that costing me something. It’s been really great to be a part of it.</blockquote><p name="213d" id="213d" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--blockquote"><span class="graf-dropCap">2</span> We’ll need to distance earlybird prices from the event date, because the window is too wide so our bookings always come too late for one bill of another. We’re sorry, but it stresses us out so much that it needs to become a rarer thing, to encourage earlier bookings.</p><p name="b539" id="b539" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p"><span class="graf-dropCap">3</span> Because of the scope and scale of next year’s event, there’s one more chance we can’t take. We’ll need to set a pre-sale threshold so that if we don’t see enough sales by a certain date we can safely cancel the venue and refund your tickets (and hopefully not go broke paying the fees). We don’t yet know the amount or the cut-off dates, but if we can plot it out, it keeps the event and attendees from risk without needing to resort to a Kickstarter campaign. Kickstarter conventions are cool and sustainable (some of my favourites do it every year), but it’s not a path I’m keen to go down for ours.</p><p name="7e6f" id="7e6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, that’s about all I wanted to share this week, but we are working on a poster to celebrate our fifth birthday next year…and maybe we should plan a cake?</p><figure name="f2f2" id="f2f2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 351px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 50.2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*WgrjX708bx-vYNOy7G8etA.gif" data-width="823" data-height="413" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WgrjX708bx-vYNOy7G8etA.gif"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">MAKE A WISH!</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><section name="1775" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="4d62" id="4d62" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--leading graf--trailing">Buy tickets: <a href="https://EttinCon.org#tickets" data-href="https://EttinCon.org#tickets" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EttinCon.org#tickets</a><br>Run a game: <a href="https://EttinCon.org/run" data-href="https://EttinCon.org/run" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">EttinCon.org/run</a><br>Lend a game: <a href="https://ettincon.org/#cta" data-href="https://ettincon.org/#cta" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EttinCon.org/#cta</a></blockquote></div></div></section><section name="0ad4" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="d9e0" id="d9e0" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">-Matt Horam,<br>Con Org for Ettin Con<br></em><a href="mailto:info@EttinCon.org" data-href="mailto:info@EttinCon.org" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">info@EttinCon.org</em></a></p></div></div></section>
