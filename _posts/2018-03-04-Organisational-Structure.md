<section name="a577" class="section section--body section--first"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="f6a8" id="f6a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This week’s topic stems from an online exchange which raised the topic of staffing. Specifically, the delegation of duties, and the ways things can start to break down when the workload isn’t balanced as well as you’d like. One of the goals of this blog is to reveal the workings of our organisation, and it’s clear how much that is needed when we’re reminded how the opaque public face of an event can inspire a variety of assumptions about how it functions.</p><p name="e3fe" id="e3fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Understaffing the core of your organisation can lead to a situation where your audience, the convention attendees, aren’t given proper focus. It’s easy for extra tasks to surround each staffer in lieu of a delegate, inevitably degrading the quality of your event at some point. If you don’t have the right mindset, this can lead to resentment, or burnout, or both. What’s worse, you could create a choke-point of communication during your event. The pressure of someone (or multiple people) beside you needing an answer RIGHT NOW can make you forget how anything works, fumbling or failing at tasks you could easily handle any week before or after the event. You could momentarily become less than one capable person by insisting upon doing the jobs of many. I’ve had those moments, it’s strange as heck.</p>

<p name="3674" id="3674" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As our event has grown, so have the number of volunteers who have time to spare on the day, which is just the greatest! What you also need to survive, thrive and excel, though, is a team of people championing certain areas of the organisation. That way, the workload spreads out and puts the audience in focus. No single organiser can train everyone, or oversee everything. Get yourself a team of passionate people ready to take a slice of the workload, so that each of you has a small and concentrated responsibility, easily handled.</p>

<p name="ec03" id="ec03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Oh my gosh, how cool is that? If you can get a half-dozen people with different skill-sets, willing to recruit/manage the volunteers they need for their portion of the event (or just keep some of the plates spinning between events so that you meet your deadlines and vault over your milestones), you’re set. During the event, those organisers don’t need to be on-duty all day, just on-call from their section if the on-duty staff require guidance. Ideally, they’d take a shift alongside the other volunteers, plus you’d have lines of reporting, and always someone else to ask for help or information.</p><p name="ef41" id="ef41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, my thoughts this week are all about working toward that ideal. Finding those blue dots, those key people we’ve been dreaming of for years, to ensure the livelihood of our event, and maybe making it all the grander things we want it to be.</p><p name="9246" id="9246" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">-Matt Horam, Con Org for </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Ettin Con</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">.</em></p></div></div></section><section name="76e5" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="9bb1" id="9bb1" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--leading">Are you one of those people?
