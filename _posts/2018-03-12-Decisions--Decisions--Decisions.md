<section name="867f" class="section section--body section--first"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="0b3c" id="0b3c" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">Decisions, Decisions, Decisions…</h3><p name="4f63" id="4f63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Even when you have lots of data, historic learnings, and personal preferences, it’s difficult to make choices about the future of your events. Venue changes, methodologies, new tactics or ideas to trial, all of these come with significant risks to not only the enjoyment of your guests, but the perception, reputation and overall survival of your event-as-brand.</p><p name="27a0" id="27a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This week, for want of any better ideas, I’m going to waffle on about the sorts of choices laid before us by circumstance, and the struggle to determine the best path based on a number of known factors (and possible outcomes) alongside a similar number of unknown factors (and potential side-effects). We use a Google Form/Spreadsheet combo to collect &amp; collate feedback about event satisfaction, opinions about the future, and general comments. It’s really helpful, but it’s only part of the puzzle you’re assembling in this role.</p><blockquote name="fa3d" id="fa3d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The first thing we’re facing right now is the standard task of scheduling our next event, now with the added bonus of choosing between two venues for the second time. The second is the <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">ever-present spectre</strong> of the <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">two-day model</em>.</blockquote><p name="fbe5" id="fbe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The (comparitively) easy task is choosing a date from those available at our choice of venue, balanced against local events and other conventions which could be competing for the attention of our audience. With EyeCon and SydCon running in Autumn and Spring, we decided to go with Summer and Winter in order to give them respectful distance. It also kept away from other things like medieval faires and family birthdays, which is good. The ease of branding our Summer event Red and our Winter event Blue was an added bonus, but having to deal with extremes of weather in council-run venues is (as previously mentioned) not the easiest thing for events of our size and duration.</p><p name="1410" id="1410" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having hosted a Summer event at a larger, simpler, slightly-cooler-yet-vastly-noisier venue, we have arrived at another fork in the road. We are familiar with the noise levels and heating at the old venue, and can manage it if we limited ticket sales down to their old levels. It’s not as easy to run an event there, and the spaces aren’t ideal, but it could work. Conversely, we haven’t experienced the gas heaters at the new venue so we’re not sure of their efficacy, and the noise issue in the main hall remains (more on that later). To complicate things, the feedback from our survey indicates that most respondents [a] think the noise at the new venue is a real problem, but [b]would prefer to see the Winter event held there. In at least one of those cases, the same person held both opinions. The survey accounts for less than 5% of our audience, so we’re over a barrel between the popular opinon of the vocal minority and simply not knowing how comfortable the heaters could make the new space. Either way, the noise problem at the new venue makes me inclined to limit the tickets to previous numbers, wherever it’s held.</p><p name="414e" id="414e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Putting that aside (sorta) brings us to the old chestnut of the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">two-day model</em>. It makes sense to run the event all weekend. Lots of people are making the trip up from other suburbs, cities or states, and many are already booking accommodation. In many ways, a two-day event makes it worth their while, and our ticket prices have remained so low that many people tell us they would pay double — We’d just like to give them another day to enjoy themselves.</p><p name="dd17" id="dd17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What if the two-day model could reduce the noise issue? We could move most/all RPG sessions into the quieter space, run for the usual twelve hours on Saturday, and another eight on Sunday. The second day would be cheaper, of course, would increase our capacity for RPG sessions overall, and reduce crowding/noise in the main hall, leaving a consistent path for wheelchairs and prams. This could work in the old venue, too. Costs are manageable, and lots of people have been asking for two days for a long time, it’s just never been possible due to the unpredictability of cash sales alongside people’s reluctance to commit to pre-sale tickets. We get it, commitment is hard, people want to leave their options open. That’s understandable, but there are some things we can’t plan or prepare without warning, hence the phrasing in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1febbBKh0f1yE26Ihmk9Zomu07wxD8EQM2b4IMuwBsG8" data-href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1febbBKh0f1yE26Ihmk9Zomu07wxD8EQM2b4IMuwBsG8" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our latest survey</a>:</p><figure name="c6f7" id="c6f7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 577px; max-height: 158px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 27.400000000000002%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*-W0tsa3bp_WuBGRVqLpQtQ.png" data-width="577" data-height="158" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-W0tsa3bp_WuBGRVqLpQtQ.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">We really should’ve spelled it out a year ago, but we’re very busy, learning slowly.</figcaption></figure><p name="0a77" id="0a77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The last factor in all of this is that things typically go quiet right after our events. We’re tired, volunteers are glad to get back to their own lives, and the infrequent <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">WHEN IS THE NEXT EVENT</strong> questions can be temporarily placated by our honest “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">We’re working on it</em>” response. In the back of my mind, a tiny clock ticks passive-aggressively. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Just give it another week</em>, I tell myself. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">You’ll think of something, a volunteer will reach out, the team will get broader, the decisions spreading out so as to be easier to make for the good of all</em>.</p><p name="8528" id="8528" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So it looks like we have three choices to make, very little data upon which to base them, and very few people to deliberate upon them. But I think we’ll get there, we always do. We just need a tiny bit more time, maybe a tiny bit more data, and many more minds and voices getting involved to help work it through. The last thing we want is just one person making the decisions which affect so many people. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I must be stopped</strong>.</p><p name="b3d9" id="b3d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">-Matt Horam, Con Org for </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Ettin Con</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">.</em></p></div></div></section><section name="a4e4" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="b256" id="b256" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--leading graf--trailing">Can you stop Matt before it’s too late?
