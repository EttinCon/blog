Social profiles, preview images for link sharing, tickets to go onsale ASAP because we lost three weeks to circumstance, the madness begins afresh, and we couldn’t be happier to dance in the fire again.</p><p name="e9ad" id="e9ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have a few things to sort out behind the scenes, like confirming sponsors and stallholders, seeing if anyone would like to run any demonstrations or competitions, etc. Lots of little jobs start right now, and the sooner there’ll all sorted, the sooner things can chug away in the background on semi-autopilot until closer to the day. So I reach out to a couple of people, have a small panic attack wherein I second-guess our chosen date and then -DEEP BREATH- just commit to it, make it happen.</p><p name="9847" id="9847" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is going to be a different event for us, because of various changes to availability across sponsors and vendors, but everything tends to balance out. If we have fewer stalls, that’s more playspace, and we would prefer to have more room between tables this time. Showcasing different vendors or activities could also keep things new &amp; interesting for returning attendees.</p><p name="6b73" id="6b73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We ended up continuing at the new venue because [1] the majority of feedback asked us to, and [2] it’s just a larger, simpler space to deal with. We’ve heard the heating is adequate, and will find out the only way we can: by trying it out with our crowd in early August. As always, the mountains are chilly in Winter, especially to visitors from warmer regions, but if you dress well and partake of soup and hot chocolate, the gas heaters and general body warmth of two-to-three-hundred respiring gamers should do the trick.</p><p name="4cd5" id="4cd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, with everything updated and some short posts across social media channels, all we need is the email out to the newsletter subscribers and for the automated processes on the site to open sales the next morning. We’ve changed the cutoff for early-bird discounts back to one month from the event in order to reinforce the need for early sales, and all online sales will end two weeks after that in order to allow us organisational time, booking items and people into version two of our library software, printing library cards with their barcodes for faster check-in/out, and so on.</p><p name="1417" id="1417" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Next, to finalise the T-shirt design and start accepting pre-orders for those in order to have the best selection of sizes for those interested. It’s been a couple of years since we could afford to do shirts - actually the first time we’ve been confident to pay for some or all of the batch ourselves, rather than investing personal money (the latter being a situation best avoided for everyone), so it’s exciting to know they’ll happen again.</p><p name="b964" id="b964" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This post should really be a short one, because the poster’s taking up so much room, and I’ve got a steadily-expanding list of tasks ahead of me which I should organise and try to delegate to anyone able to help. I’ll see which of those is worth documenting and detail them in future blog entries between now and August.
